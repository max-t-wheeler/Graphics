This is a simple application consisting of a navigation pane and a canvas. 

Clicking through each item in the pane will render the associated animation to the canvas. 

This is my first go at an application made using Vue.js; the model is rather primitive, but I've managed to make my way up to components, so that's neat.

The animations are recreations of similar projects I'd done earlier in OpenGL. I've employed threejs to generate the animations swiftly.

There's still plenty more to come, so check back for updates every once in a while.

Hope you dig it.
